    "# Day 10 - Cathode-Ray Tube\n",
    "\n",
    ">You avoid the ropes, plunge into the river, and swim to shore.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The Elves yell something about meeting back up with them upriver, but the river is too loud to tell exactly what they're saying. They finish crossing the bridge and disappear from view.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Situations like this must be why the Elves prioritized getting the communication system on your handheld device working. You pull it out of your pack, but the amount of water slowly draining from a big crack in its screen tells you it probably won't be of much immediate use.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Unless, that is, you can design a replacement for the device's video system! It seems to be some kind of cathode-ray tube screen and simple CPU that are both driven by a precise clock circuit. The clock circuit ticks at a constant rate; each tick is called a cycle.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Start by figuring out the signal being sent by the CPU. The CPU has a single register, X, which starts with the value 1. It supports only two instructions:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- `addx V` takes two cycles to complete. After two cycles, the X register is increased by the value V. (V can be negative.)\n",
    ">- `noop` takes one cycle to complete. It has no other effect.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The CPU uses these instructions in a program (your puzzle input) to, somehow, tell the screen what to draw.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Consider the following small program:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">noop\n",
    ">addx 3\n",
    ">addx -5\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">Execution of this program proceeds as follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- At the start of the first cycle, the noop instruction begins execution. During the first cycle, X is 1. After the first cycle, the noop instruction finishes execution, doing nothing.\n",
    ">- At the start of the second cycle, the addx 3 instruction begins execution. During the second cycle, X is still 1.\n",
    ">- During the third cycle, X is still 1. After the third cycle, the addx 3 instruction finishes execution, setting X to 4.\n",
    ">- At the start of the fourth cycle, the addx -5 instruction begins execution. During the fourth cycle, X is still 4.\n",
    ">- During the fifth cycle, X is still 4. After the fifth cycle, the addx -5 instruction finishes execution, setting X to -1.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Maybe you can learn something by looking at the value of the X register throughout execution. For now, consider the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register) during the 20th cycle and every 40 cycles after that (that is, during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles).\n",

    "To start, we need to build our CPU. I'm calling it an `interpreter` since that is what our program execution is: we go line by line and execute what we see.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have the state of our interpreter: it knows the value in the `register` (this is the register X in the description), it has a clock `cycle`, it has an `index` for which instruction we are currently executing (this is due to some instructions taking multiple cycles) and a helper `execute_add` flag to keep track of which cycle inside the addx instruction we are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I built this interpreter as a generator so we can inspect it at each clock cycle and then build all the functionality we want, separate from the execution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's talk about Python generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we've used generator expressions (for example, `sum(1 for _ in booleans)`) where we generate a value on each iteration but we don't create a new list in memory. We're doing similar here but instead, we have a function that we write and instead of `return`ing a value and stopping the execution of the function, we `yield` a value and continue the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simpler example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generator(start=0):\n",
    "    number = start\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        yield number\n",
    "        number += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a generator that gets a number as a parameter and then runs a never-ending loop. On each loop iteration, it `yields` (returns) a number and increases it on one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we'd then use this generator is that we first initialize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = generator(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can then call `next` function with this generator to get its next value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(next(numbers)) # Prints 0\n",
    "print(next(numbers)) # Prints 1\n",
    "print(next(numbers)) # Prints 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or we can iterate over it for example in a for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "    if num > 10:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our generator is infinite, we need to figure out the break point ourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that if we'd run all of the above three blocks in a row, the for loop would start with the value 3 because we've already run the generator a few rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back to our interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the while loop for as long as there are program instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cycle, we start by returning the current `cycle` and `register` values. Then we take the command and update the internal state based on the instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a `noop`, we just increment `cycle` and `index`. For `addx` instruction, if we're on the second cycle, we add the `value` to `register`, increment `cycle` and `index` and mark `execute_add` to `False` so the next `addx` instruction won't immediately trigger.\n",
