    "# Day 8 - Treetop Tree House\n",
    "\n",
    "> The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house hidden. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:\n",

    ">65332\n",
    ">33549\n",
    ">35390\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- The top-left 5 is visible from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height 5 are in the way.)\n",
    ">- The top-middle 5 is visible from the top and right.\n",
    ">- The top-right 1 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height 0 between it and an edge.\n",
    ">- The left-middle 5 is visible, but only from the right.\n",
    ">- The center 3 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height 2 between it and an edge.\n",
    ">- The right-middle 3 is visible from the right.\n",
    ">- In the bottom row, the middle 5 is visible, but the 3 and 4 are not.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of 21 trees are visible in this arrangement.\n",

By using `*` operator, we unpack our `grid` which in this case would be the same as writing `zip(grid[0], grid[1], grid[2])` but with the `*`, we make it general and work with any size of a matrix.\n",
