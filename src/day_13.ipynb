    "# Day 13 - Distress Signal\n",
    "\n",
    ">You climb the hill and again try contacting the Elves. However, you instead receive a signal you weren't expecting: a distress signal.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Your handheld device must still not be working properly; the packets from the distress signal got decoded out of order. You'll need to re-order the list of received packets (your puzzle input) to decode the message.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Your list consists of pairs of packets; pairs are separated by a blank line. You need to identify how many pairs of packets are in the right order.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example:\n",
    ">```\n",
    ">[1,1,3,1,1]\n",
    ">[1,1,5,1,1]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">[[1],[2,3,4]]\n",
    ">[[1],4]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">[9]\n",
    ">[[8,7,6]]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">[[4,4],4,4]\n",
    ">[[4,4],4,4,4]\n",
    ">\n",
    ">[7,7,7,7]\n",
    ">[7,7,7]\n",

    ">```\n",
    ">Packet data consists of lists and integers. Each list starts with [, ends with ], and contains zero or more comma-separated values (either integers or other lists). Each packet is always a list and appears on its own line.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">When comparing two values, the first value is called left and the second value is called right. Then:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- If both values are integers, the lower integer should come first. If the left integer is lower than the right integer, the inputs are in the right order. If the left integer is higher than the right integer, the inputs are not in the right order. Otherwise, the inputs are the same integer; continue checking the next part of the input.\n",
    ">- If both values are lists, compare the first value of each list, then the second value, and so on. If the left list runs out of items first, the inputs are in the right order. If the right list runs out of items first, the inputs are not in the right order. If the lists are the same length and no comparison makes a decision about the order, continue checking the next part of the input.\n",
    ">- If exactly one value is an integer, convert the integer to a list which contains that integer as its only value, then retry the comparison. For example, if comparing [0,0,0] and 2, convert the right value to [2] (a list containing 2); the result is then found by instead comparing [0,0,0] and [2].\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Using these rules, you can determine which of the pairs in the example are in the right order:\n",
    ">```\n",

    ">  - Compare 1 vs 1\n",

    ">  - Compare 3 vs 5\n",

    "## Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need a compare function. As you can maybe see from the docstring, I built this in a very TDD-manner and that was a blessing since it helped me increase the complexity little by little without having to worry if everything was still working correctly. Especially because my solution is recursive and if you've been following along, that's a challenge for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with the basic rules provided by the instruction, then followed them with tests for the example input and once everything passed, I was good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, my part 1 compare function returned `True`/`False`/`None` (probably should have realized at that point that an integer solution was the way to go). When I learned about part 2, I refactored it to function as a proper compare function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally I handled the \"unequal lengths\" case with catching an `IndexError` and in that case, comparing the lengths of the two lists. But I then refactored it to use [`itertools.zip_longest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest) with `fillvalue=None` so I can just check if either element in pair is `None` and act accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do compare functions work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A compare function (I guess in most languages?) work in a way that it takes two inputs, in this case `left` and `right` and returns a negative number if `left` is smaller, a positive number if `right` is smaller and 0 if they are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "With integers here (either number itself or length of a list), we can just do subtract operations. That cleans up that code a lot. I used to have if/elif/else cases in the original solution where I now have a single subtract.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test-Driven Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is a good day to talk about [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). It's hard to see from the output alone that it is indeed what I have done but I use it especially with these kind of cases: rather small function with potentially lots of complexity hidden inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TDD, you first create a test case (I use [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) here but [there are other options too](https://hamatti.org/posts/unit-test-your-python-code-in-jupyter-notebooks/)), fail it, then make it pass and then refactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I started by defining that my `compare` function with inputs `1` and `2` would return `-1` (actually, when I started, it return `True` and then later refactored to this). I would then implement the function body as something that makes it work (for example, `if left < right: return True`). Some purists would argue that just returning `True` would be the right approach but I'm okay with skipping steps in a case like this where I know what direction we're going.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then added the second case, made that work and refactored the code. Next case, make it work, make it pretty. And continue until every case you have passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't practice TDD religiously but I tend to use it for more complex functions in Advent of Code (and occasionally in real life too) and really like it. It helps me get to the right result one small step at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And once everything works, you have the test cases so doing bigger refactorings is safe(r) too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bring in the walrus `:=`\n",
    "\n",
    "On my latest refactoring of this code, I got to use Python's walrus operator (`:=`) for the first time. Walrus operator got [added to Python in 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions) but I've never been to keen on assigning in if statements. I decided to give it a try finally today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, it's called walrus operator because `:=` [looks a bit like walrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walrus#/media/File:Pacific_Walrus_-_Bull_(8247646168).jpg).\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the way it works is that it allows you to assign a value inside an `if` (or `while`) statement and then it uses that value in the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, it allows you to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "res = compare(l, r)\n",
    "if res != 0:\n",
    "    return res\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in more compact way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (res := compare(l, r)) != 0:\n",
    "    return res\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The [\"What's New in Python 3.8\"](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions) document makes a good note about walrus:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Try to limit use of the walrus operator to clean cases that reduce complexity and improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not sure if my use of walrus today improved the readability of my code. I guess it's a matter of how used to the operator you are and how much you like assigning in if conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used it here because I wanted to learn it and get more comfortable with something that's been in the language  for over 3 years already (oh how time flies)."
